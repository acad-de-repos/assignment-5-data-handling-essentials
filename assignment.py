  """
  Prepares a dataset for machine learning by cleaning, transforming, and engineering features.

  This function covers a typical data preparation pipeline:
  1. Loading data from multiple sources (DB and CSV)
  2. Merging datasets
  3. Data cleaning (handling missing values and types)
  4. Feature engineering
  5. One-hot encoding categorical features
  6. Exporting the final dataset

  Args:
    db_connection: An active database connection object.
    csv_file_path: The path to the employee performance CSV file.
  """
  # Task 1: Load data from database and CSV
  # Hint: Use pd.read_sql_table() and pd.read_csv()
  employees_df = None
  performance_df = None
  # Your code here

  # Task 2: Merge the two datasets
  # Hint: Use pd.merge() on the employee ID
  merged_df = None
  # Your code here

  # Task 3: Clean the merged dataset
  # Hint: Use .fillna() for missing scores and pd.to_datetime() for dates
  # Your code here

  # Task 4: Create the 'days_since_start' feature
  # Hint: Subtract the start_date from a reference date (e.g., '2025-01-01')
  # Your code here

  # Task 5: One-hot encode the department column
  # Hint: Use pd.get_dummies() to create binary columns for each department
  # Your code here

  # Task 6: Export the prepared data
  # Hint: Use df.to_csv() to save the final DataFrame
  # Your code here
